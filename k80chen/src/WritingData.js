    <p className="article-text">From Adam and Eve to Jesus Christ, from your regular Colombian family to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, from picadors to matadors, from animals to still life, everything comes in size XL. Nor does standing among the greatest artists in history spare you of the inflated fortune. Here, even Cezanne and Velazquez come in plus size. Double the fame, square the size.</p>

    <p className="article-text">This is Fernando Botero style.</p>

    <p className="article-text">Born in Medellín, Colombia in 1932, Botero was a son of a merchant and a designer. At the age of 12, Botero enrolled in a bullfight school. Bullfight and bullfighters later became a prominent subject of his paintings. In the year of 1952, Botero moved to Europe, where he continued his self-education by copying works of the Spanish and Italian masters, especially those of the Renaissance painters. Today, in between the enlarged figures of Botero’s painting radiates the Renaissance virtuoso. And as one strolls down the aisle in a Botero gallery, one would resonate with Botero’s reminiscence of the great Renaissance and Baroque masters. After returning from Europe, Botero lived in Mexico, where he encountered artworks by Orozco, Rivera and Siqueiros. Later his travels to New York exposed him to Abstract Expressionism, from which he acquired the loose, visible brushstrokes. His works are seen all across the world, from Spain to Paris to Park Avenue in New York City (even to NYU’s very Stern building), but he donated his work mostly to Museo Botero in Bogota, and Museo de Antioquia in Medellín.</p>

    <h3>Oh Women</h3>

    <p>Oh women. The most mysterious creature that walks the earth. An artist’s muse… Or nightmare.</p>


<p>In his book Botero: Women, Botero said “If women are often my subjects, it’s because they have been one of the main subjects of painting for centuries”.</p>


<p>Botero’s women are everything: they are noble dowagers with a fox tail wrapped around their collar; they are stylish donnas gussied up to the nines, with their cigar in hand; they are frivolous prostitutes soliciting in a brothel; they are exhausted Colombian moms having a drink after a long day; they are women in the public sight, composed and reserved; they are women in their most private moments, naked and unembellished, their body hair blatantly visible… They are vulgar and polished, reserved and luscious, humble and proud, coarse and sophisticated, modest and presumptuous. Their personalities are as big as their voluptuous figures.</p>

<p>Botero’s women are far from perfect, but at least they are candid. They are not representations; they are the gender roles, societal obligations, and characteristics that they embody, gesticulating a Latin American exuberance.</p>

<p>I kept wondering what to make of their small unblinking eyes and pursed lips, their swelling hips and sensuous bodies? Are they pretty women? Probably not. But strangely one feels drawn towards them. And strangely still when the eye meets the candid bodies on the canvas, the eye feels compelled to shift away. Is it because such ruthless honesty is too difficult to swallow? Or is it that we are not accustomed to shop around without a size 2 and size 4 difference? Amid many feminist movements on body image, maybe this is Botero’s hashtag.</p>

<p>When I look at Botero’s women, I see women who are relatable, women of reality, women of the mundane, women of life, and of what life has made them become.</p>

These buildings are designed by Jewish architects who studied at Germany in the Bauhaus School and escaped Europe after the rise of the Nazi regime. Bauhaus architectural style is identified as minimalistic, simplistic, with an emphasis on functionality and practicality.",
